  You have to get the props of whatever is mounted

  then you gotta get the prop of that prop.
  Note: You have to do some 'deep diving' into each child to get the prop to compare to.
  I'll console.log() these to show it's actually pulling out what I need, and put them each in their own prop.
  There has to be a better way then just deep reaching into each of these to get one prop; I'll investigate later if I have time.
